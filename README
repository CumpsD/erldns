Erlang DNS Server
=================
... or something that slightly resembles the beginnings of such a thing.

Dug this up on an old backup CD.

A few years back I stared on a small journey to learn erlang. To me it seemed 
that a DNS server would be a good place to start since the DNS protocol is 
simple, well documented, and erlang is great at dealing with high levels of
concurrency and binary data protocols.

Unfortunately, I never finished it. The current state of the service is to
simply reply to all queries with a canned response.

A good next step would to simply be a passive DNS server. Then perhaps add
caching. After that, add the ability to define zones that pass their queries
to different DNS servers. Add recursion. Then add a local database.

Erlang is a neat language and I think it's the ideal choice for these kinds
of services. One day I hope to get back to it.
